# Maya-Penrose-Steps-Project#

As part of my Msc Course I created a small animated scene in Maya. All parts of the project were done by me. I also wrote a MEL Script that would place the penguins in the stands, as shown in the step process below. I've included a production support materials document for a more detailed breakdown.
